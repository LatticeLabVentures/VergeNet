# Horizon CLI
CLI is a utility that provides a command-line interface to all the components to the Horizon bridge and allow performing end-to-end bridge functionalities. A reference implementation is available under [near's rainbow-bridge cli](https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge/tree/master/cli), which can be used to develop this component.
